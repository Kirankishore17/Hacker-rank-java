### 1.Sum of non negative slice.

Given an array A, we need to find the sum of maximum sum of the non-negative slice.
Example: Let's say A = [ 1234513212 2], then we have 3 slices [1, 2, 3], [5, 1, 3] and [12, 2]. Occurrence of a negative number ends the slice.From these slices we have find the maximum sum. Which in this example would be 12, 2 = 14.

Input Format:
First line of the input will be the length of the array followed by the array elements.

Output Format:
Return the maximum sum of the non-negative slice.

### 2.Maximum occurrences of 1's

Given an array A=[0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0] of size n.
You have to print max count of 1's in given array are 1,1,1,1 and it repeated 2 times.
So it has to consider first occurrence of 1,1,1,1 and it's starting index position is '4".
Note: If array doesn't have 1's and having only 0's then it has to return -1 value.

Input Format: 1st line size of array n next size line element of array

Output Format: Integer
